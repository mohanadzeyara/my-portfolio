# Mohand Zeyara - Student Portfolio (Next.js)

This is a simple, student-made Next.js portfolio for Mohand Zeyara (FAU — Medizintechnik). It includes:
- Pages: Home, About, Projects (server-side rendered), Contact
- Simple styling with CSS modules + globals
- Placeholder profile image (public/profile.svg)

## Quick local run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Deploy to Vercel (recommended)
1. Create a GitHub repo and push this project.
2. Sign in to https://vercel.com and import your repo.
3. Deploy — Vercel detects Next.js automatically.

## Customize
- Replace `public/profile.svg` with your photo (keep the filename or update `pages/index.js`).
- Edit text in `pages/*.js` (name, bio, email, projects).

Good luck — this is intentionally modest to look like a student submission.
